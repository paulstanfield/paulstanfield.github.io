   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The iPhones great for checking the ridiculous amount of social media accounts people have, consuming all those viral youtube videos and checking out the latest addictive game that has taken the App Store by storm. I also use my iPhone quite heavily to keep on top of things in my working life, wether that be gaining inspiration for the next design project or keeping on top of my freelance business. Check out some of the app’s that are currently helping me along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With multiple projects on the go and different tasks being associated with them at varying deadline dates a simple to do list app just isn’t cutting it for me. Things solves this problem by allowing me to make detailed project lists and notes for all things relating to a project. I’ve tried out a few apps like this in the past but Things ticks all the boxes in terms of price, usability and iCloud syncing. Having it on home screen on my iPhone gives me a constant reminder what needs done, and with the added refresh to the UI and increased use of notifications that has just been rolled out for IOS8, the app has just got a whole lot better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrome - For a while now I have liked to keep two browsers on the go at all times for various tasks. I don’t know a lot of people who do this but it suits my workflow perfectly. I keep Safari dedicated to my personal browsing, be that Facebook, SkySports News, MacRumours, Youtube etc and then use Google Chrome as my dedicated browser for all things work related. This allows me to stay focused on the task at hand during the working day without being distracted by open tabs which may cause a distraction. This works a treat on the desktop with two different browser windows running at the same time being a piece of cake, I like to bring this experience over to the iPhone tho for quick referral on links and accounts, so Google Chrome’s IOS browser app does the job perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;

   <title>New Things, New Blog</title>
   <link href="http://paulstanfield.co.uk/2014/09/29/new-things-new-blog-post/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://paulstanfield.co.uk/2014/09/29/new-things-new-blog-post</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like most people who have a keen interest in something whether it be in their work or personal life, the notion of ‘Why don’t I start a blog?’ often creeps to mind once a while without ever leading to any real end product. Recently I’ve been toying with this idea back and forth myself with the usual negative concerns associated with it of ‘Will I post regularly?’, ‘Is it really worth the hassle? etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing on the things which inevitably hold us back from doing things, I’ve decided to get of the sofa from playing another round of video games and actually start the blog, it might not lead to anything, but you’ll never know where something will go unless you give it a fair old try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here’s the blog! its up, its running, it lives on the internet! So far so good I’d say, no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to be more productive in my life and change a few things up, whether it be taking on more design work both in a freelance and personal capacity, getting more exercise, reading more books etc. Just little bits and pieces to ultimately try and gain a better and happier life during the working week and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this blog will give you a bit of an insight into that and maybe allow me to share some of things I’ll hopefully learn along the way, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
